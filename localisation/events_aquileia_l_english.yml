 aquileia.1.t:0 "The Discret Takeover"
 aquileia.1.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s refusal, and even opposition on enacting reforms that would benefit the higher classes, combined with his inaction towards the least loyal parts of his kingdom, has made the nobility in Aquileia grow embittered. Viewing the current king as an incompetent fool and traitor to what made Aquileia grand, the court started plotting a conspiracy to take over the throne once the current reigning monarchy dies. After a lengthy and grandiose funeral, the throne of Aquileia was left to a still young and especially unprepared heir that had not yet finished his education on the matters of the state, the court chose Aimery Discret as his regent. Though, on the same day, on a meeting that took place in the Palais Royal on [GetDateText], they have declared the Marignys unfit to lead Aquileia into this new 'future'. Together with like-minded nobles in Aquila they have begun embarking on a realm-wide takeover."

 aquileia.2.t:0 "The Realm Breaks Apart"
 aquileia.2.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the nature of the nobility has it that it was impossible for members of the aristocracy to work together. Mere days after the court took over the ruling of the realm, Aimery Discret, the heir's regent, turned on his former allies and crowned himself as the new King of Aquileia.\n\nHowever, when the ”Crown”'s dispatched messengers arrived to the towns and lands furthest away from the capital, their responses were immediate as the lords of Pomovarra, Greifwald and Tarrin refused to recognize the Discret's legitimacy while the Duke of Westtry just refused to communicate with the new King in charge. Even then, we still have to mention the consequences closer to home that the new King did not consider, the nobles and landowners of Vinovia and Flowerino saw the new monarch as untrustworthy, and demanded that [Root.Monarch.GetName] give them concessions to safekeep their loyalty, meanwhile, the monastic orders of Rila made their dislike of the Discrets plain, and likewise demanded more autonomy in return for their service to the Crown of Aquileia."
 aquileia.2.a:0 "Santé."
