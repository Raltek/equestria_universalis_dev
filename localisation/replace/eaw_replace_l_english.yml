 mil_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "Charging blindly at the enemy is perhaps not the greatest tactic available, but it is one of the simplest to master. It is also the stepping stone to more advanced strategies."
 mil_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "By the end of the 5th Century ALB, the land armies had become more professional and well organized. Better systems are in place to support the mix of levies and professional soldiers that now dominate the battlefields and the power of land infantry is slowly but steadily gaining against flight based armies."
 mil_tech_cs_4_desc:0 "Throughout the ALB age knights’ dominance was being challenged by disciplined pike-carriers. In some battles on Griffonia, knights were defeated by pikes. A combination of improved training and discipline, and the addition of sword fighters to provide close combat support has raised this formation to the peak of its efficiency."
 mil_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Although fireworks had been developed in Equestria in the 3rd century ALB and had spread to Griffonia by the 4th, they hadn’t been weaponised effectively until now. Light and reliable, the Arquebus was able to displace other ranged weapons due to three main factors. It had better armor penetration, it was easier to train creatures to use it, and it did not rely on the strength of the user."
 mil_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "Artillery had been documented in Griffonia since the 4th century, but due to its lack of mobility, it had very limited battlefield use. The development of the Limber in the 540s allowed guns to become more mobile and thus useful."
 mil_tech_cs_8_desc:0 "The Arquebus was easy to use as a weapon, but was also inaccurate and slow to fire, leaving its user vulnerable to charges by flying units. Blending with Pikes allowed Arquebusiers to fire and then fall back to be shielded by Pike-carriers when enemy flyers or infantry appeared."
 mil_tech_cs_9_desc:0 "The value of training and experience has always been great on the battlefield. With the advent of gunpowder and the tactical changes associated with it and other infantry weapons, came a great demand for units versed in these new innovations. As professional armies were still far away, this need had to be filled by mercenary units such as the Condottieri, Blackhollow Mercenaries or Landsknechte. A growing class of professional mercenary officers came to live of supplying these regiments to needing states in the middle of the military transition."
 mil_tech_cs_10_desc:0 "Pike and shot formations proved a major threat to griffonian knights. The initial response was heavier armor to counter the power of gunpowder weapons, but this slowed down the flyers, reducing their shock power. Reiters were usually armed with two pistols and a sword, allowing them to either shoot or charge depending on the opposition they faced."
 mil_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "The Sicameonese Square developed naturally from the Pike and shot formations. At its core was a traditional Pike Square. At each of the corners it had a group of Arquebusiers. It kept the staying power of the traditional pike square and enhanced it with the firepower of the Arquebus."
 mil_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "The size and depth of the Sicameonese Square gave it staying power but made it slow and cumbersome to maneuver on the battlefield. It also led to a large percentage of troops being inactive during battles. Maurice Weijermars, the Duke of De Vleugels, reduced the total number of creatures in the formation to make it more mobile and reduced its depth, so it maintained the same firepower and shock values."
 mil_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "With artillery's growing importance in the battlefield, also the number of firearms kept increasing. But because each gun was made separately, it also required great effort to resupply. Leaders of the 7th century were quick to declare standard calibres ."
 mil_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "The matchlock firing mechanism's biggest weakness was the need to keep the match lit in order to fire the weapon. Although the wheellock was developed, it was too expensive to produce to enter into mass use. The development of flintlock created a more reliable weapon."
 mil_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "Grover, Custodian of Griffonstone, further developed infantry units to improve their firepower. His infantry formations were narrowed and made rectangular to increase the number of muskets that could fire in each volley. Attachment of small artillery pieces further increased the firepower of infantry."
 mil_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "Thanks to bayonets, each musketeer could function as a pike-carrier as well. This allowed pikes to be removed from infantry equipment and provided infantry formations with more firepower."
 mil_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "In the 740s the idea of combining the shot and powder into a single unit, a cartridge, allowed for faster reloading and thus firing. This in turn dramatically improved the firepower of guns."
 mil_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "Heavily armored knights or pegasi were by their nature cumbersome to form up and vulnerable on the battlefield. Lighter flying units were added to armies to act as scouts for the army during marching and screen the heavier units before their charge on the battlefield."
 mil_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "First introduced to the Groverian army as irregular troops from the military frontier, Light Infantry Companies were deployed in loose order and proved to be very effective at harassing enemy and leading assaults on entrenchments."
 mil_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "Although a cuirass had existed for many years, only recently a new style of armourmaking gained popularity, which saw magically enhanced armor fuse with the latest technology, which provided better balance between protection to the key parts of the body and mobility."

 adm_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "As social organization improves, so do things like food production. Increasing food production allows a society to upkeep people who aren't producers of food themselves. This leads to creation of a military elite, to defend against the enemy's military elite. Supporting of the elite is the basis of the monarchical or diarchic system."
 adm_tech_cs_3_desc:0 "With a military elite to govern our society, the next stage of development is to have a literate class of administrators. Usually these will be drawn from the ranks of the religious authorities."
 adm_tech_cs_6_desc:0 "Prior to the Industrial Revolution the Workshop- or Putting-out System was used in Early Modern Equus to organize the production of everything from Textiles to Wrought Iron. With materials provided, craftsponies could refine various goods either in workshops or in their own home, bypassing the rigid restrictions of the guilds."
 adm_tech_cs_7_desc:0 "The religious class has proven inadequate in keeping up with the demands of an ever expanding state. A new bureaucratic class must be created, drafted from new intellectuals, to keep the apparatus of state running."
 adm_tech_cs_11_desc:0 "Textiles were manufactured since time immemorial. The invention of stocking frame in 703 was the first step towards the industrial revolution and the beginning of mechanization. This invention would lead to increase in textile production."
 adm_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "In time it became apparent that a more centralized bureaucracy with administrative bodies run by educated officials employed directly by the state was a necessity for the ambitious projects of this time period’s rulers."
 adm_tech_cs_15_desc:0 "The ever increasing armies of the 5th century put bigger and harder demands on the administrative systems of states. By creating a permanent organization charged with taking care of the procuring and planning of Military supplies and by keeping more troops on the rolls even during wintertime or peacetime we will in the long run be able to field large armies more cheaply and be able to support these armies more efficiently while at war."
 adm_tech_cs_16_desc:0 "The process to produce wrought iron was under continuous improvement and by the early 6th century the finery process came to overtake the older Ospone process. Iron production could now be specialized with the working of the iron no longer taking place at the same location as it was mined and more, stronger and purer iron would in time lead to developments in many other sectors."
 adm_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "The great Yalish, Equestrian and Zebrican universities were of course great but they were not able to produce enough graduates to staff our growing administration. We need to expand our universities or we will fall behind."
 adm_tech_cs_18_desc:0 "The many and long wars of the first half of the 6th century have led to an international diplomatic system where the territorial integrity of states is a cornerstone. States rather than individual rulers or supra-national groupings are the actors on the international arena and no state has the right to intervene in the internal affairs of another."
 adm_tech_cs_19_desc:0 "Promotion of religion will be crucial for the stability of the realm. It is not enough to be great, creatures must be able to see our greatness. The ancients knew how to display their greatness and we will do the same by building monuments to withstand the test of time."
 adm_tech_cs_23_desc:0 "The new sciences have given us a number of different ways to describe and measure the world around us. Let us send these learned creatures out into the world in general and into our country in particular. We cannot know what resources are at our disposal until we have thoroughly searched all our lands for minerals, counted every last subject and assessed every last enterprise."
 adm_tech_cs_24_desc:0 "Paying for the upkeep of the army, the navy and the administration itself accounts for the majority of the expenses for any state. As these are expenses can run away quickly, however, taxes and tolls can be frustrating and inflexible ways to raise the money needed. While national debt is far from unheard of we need to come up with better plans for raising money. Bonds, tontines and other similar plans can be used both domestically and abroad to finance unforeseen expenses and will allow us to make much better use of the money we do have to develop our country."
 adm_tech_cs_27_desc:0 "In order to make the most of the lands and subjects we control we must enlarge, reorganize and professionalize our bureaucracy. A robust organization can handle each part of our state and eliminate the need for ad hoc solutions. Let us put our universities to work to consider the best ways to efficiently rule and govern and let us encourage the sons of the nobility to serve the state with a pen in hand rather than a sword."
 adm_tech_cs_28_desc:0 "The basic plow in use all over the world has been unchanged since the ancient times. Now, thanks to improvements in design, the same plough can be made much lighter, reducing workload on draft animals, allowing them to do more work."
 adm_tech_cs_29_desc:1 "At the forefront of current revolutionary thought is the radical notion of equality for all. Philosophers from different parts of the world have worked together to create a document entitled the 'Declaration of the Rights of Creatures and of the Citizen', proclaiming that these rights are universal and should be enforced by law. It is likely that this will have ample repercussions for the development and spread of the concepts of freedom and democracy, and we would do well not to lag behind."

 dip_tech_cs_1_desc:0 "The patterns of trade had been seriously disrupted in the 5th century, possibly due to plagues and pandemics. Now trade is slowly beginning to recover."
 dip_tech_cs_2_desc:0 "The barque has a long history, beginning as an Ancient Maregyptian river boat. However, since then the term has gradually come to mean a light ship."
 dip_tech_cs_12_desc:0 "Throughout the 5th century the increasing sailing ability of ships together with a growing number of more efficient guns have led to an increasing specialization of ship types. A Pone of War is a ship dedicated entirely to sea warfare with a greater number of guns and ammunition than a ship that would also have to act as a Merchant could ever hold. In the long run this development will lead to growing permanent navies and the development of naval tactics to better fit the new realities of sea warfare."
 dip_tech_cs_14_desc:0 "Galleys were light and small, and it was very difficult to mount cannons on them. The Galleass was a larger vessel capable of carrying a broadside of cannons like a pone-of-war. To compensate for this extra weight, Galleass would be equipped with an additional sail."
 dip_tech_cs_17_desc:0 "Further development of transport ships led to construction of larger and faster vessels, which still tried to maintain the simplicity of construction of the Flute. These ships fell under the generic term Merchantgriff."
 dip_tech_cs_20_desc:0 "Even at the beginning of the 6th century permanent navies were quite small and even naval powers of note would mostly maintain a naval force to meet their immediate needs. Over time, however, we are moving in the direction of a larger professional navy. Unless we want to see our rivals overtaking us in naval matters we must strive to create a larger permanent navy with an administrative structure to support it as well as ensure that a naval career can be a permanent occupation for our officers."
 dip_tech_cs_21_desc:0 "Originally developed by Sicameonese Corsairs, this galley didn't carry as many guns as a galleass, but it was smaller and far more maneuverable. This improved maneuver allowed it to be far more effective in combat."
 dip_tech_cs_22_desc:0 "In 725 a rather mad physician wrote a treatise suggesting that scurvy was a result of a dietary problem and could be solved by consuming lemon or lime juice. As it turns out, there was method in his madness and we have started providing this new diet for our sailors. Other countries call us limey now."
 dip_tech_cs_26_desc:0 "The Southzebridian was the largest merchant ship built, it typically could displace in excess of 1,000 tons and measure over 175 feet in length. Those queens of the oceans were the most efficient way of moving men and cargo around the globe."
 dip_tech_cs_29_desc:0 "Originally the midship-pone was a rank given to an experienced seapony who worked amidships. Ponies who aspired to become officers would often choose to serve in this role. If we formalize this, and make it a precondition for acquiring the rank of a commissioned officer, we will ensure our future leaders understand the ships they command."
 dip_tech_cs_30_desc:0 "A further reduction of risk came with the development of insurance. The ability for creatures to offset risk through payment of a small fee to an insurance broker allowed for further growth of trade."
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "The ongoing trade deficit between different countries has caused a shortage of silver bullion in some. Switching from silver coinage to gold coinage will allow new coinage to enter circulation and get trade flowing in ever greater amounts."
